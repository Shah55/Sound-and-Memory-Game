 ## Reflection Questions
 1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

 2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
 
 One challenge that I came across was something that I figured out a week prior to submitting but I still laugh to this day about. Initially, I was doing this project in the safari browser and when I was following the guide to adding the sound to the buttons, I noticed that the sound would never play when I clicked the buttons. I found this strange and for a good few hours of just focusing on that, I was googling reasons to why it was not working and it was getting very time consuming and frustrating. I used a variety of pages for answers to this issue, even the audio tutorial provided but nothing helped. To oversome this I told myself that I will revisit this later but in the meantime finish the rest of the project, and then while working it came to my mind that maybe I should just trying using google chrome, and to my fascination and after a few laughs I realized that the sound started playing properly. This is a very silly error that most people would find very odd to have experienced but being new to web development, I learned a lot from this one mistake. I learned how to use the internet as a resource, I discovered the MDN docs which is a very good developers resource, and realized that answers could be something so simple and just requires some thinking outside of the box to figure out. I also realized how much inexperience I have and how even a small mistake can happen and could be used to learn a lot from.
 Another challenge that I experienced was time management. At this time of doing this project, I had and still have a lot of projects and midterms to prepare for in school so it was a bit difficult to put time into both. To overcome this challenge I created a todo list and finished tasks that required immediate attention or would have deadlines that are coming up and when I was finished I would use my free time to work on this game. I also used my breaks in between classes to work on this so using effective time management really helped me shoulder both school and this internship application.


 3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  To be honest, I have a lot of questions after doing this assignment. I know that the guide had a specific way of implementing all of the parts of the project but     
  
 I was wondering if you could make those features all in one HTML file or one CSS file or one Javascript file instead of using all 3 or do all three files have to be created. 
 I want to learn the fundamentals of html, css, and javascript but I was also wondering whether there were like templates or methods professional developers use to make websites or games quicker or more easier? If so, then how do you go about using them and are there certain limitations placed upon them?
 This is a just a thought that I had on my mind throughout the whole process, but I was just wondering how web developers use these techniques to create big websites like twitter or facebook or even personal portfolios. It amazes me how much could be done and how some code could turn into a fully functional webpage.

 4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  If I had a few more hours I would definitely look into trying to make the function in the JavaScript file more efficient. I would look to find ways on how to make the code look cleaner and how to use different aspects of javascript that would make the same features I implemented much more effective. For example, I would look to see if javascript have any built in libraries or functions that would make some of my functions smaller and easier to use. 
	 I would definitely add more features to my project as well. Specifically, I don't know if glitch allows this but I was thinking of adding a falling confetti feature using CSS and HTML when the user wins the game. This would add a lot of aesthetic to the application and would make the game more enjoyable. I am still pretty new to the designing aspect, but I was very pulled in by the different CSS features that can be used to style the game so I would also add more designs and aesthetic aspects of the game.
