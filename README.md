 2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
 One challenge that I came across was something that I figured out a week prior to submitting but I still laugh to this day about. Initially, I was doing this project in the safari browser and when I was following the guide to adding the sound to the buttons, I noticed that the sound would never play when I clicked the buttons. I found this strange and for a good few hours of just focusing on that, I was googling reasons to why it was not working and it was getting very time consuming and frustrating. I used a variety of pages for answers to this issue, even the audio tutorial provided but nothing helped. To oversome this I told myself that I will revisit this later but in the meantime finish the rest of the project, and then while working it came to my mind that maybe I should just trying using google chrome, and to my fascination and after a few laughs I realized that the sound started playing properly. This is a very silly error that most people would find very odd to have experienced but being new to web development, I learned a lot from this one mistake. I learned how to use the internet as a resource, I discovered the MDN docs which is a very good developers resource, and realized that answers could be something so simple and just requires some thinking outside of the box to figure out. I also realized how much inexperience I have and how even a small mistake can happen and could be used to learn a lot from.
